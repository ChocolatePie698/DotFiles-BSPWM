2020-05-12 00:13:43	Surfie	Anyone have any good themes for awesome WM?
2020-05-12 00:17:17	zephros	i personally user pywal for my theme needw
2020-05-12 00:17:21	zephros	*needs
2020-05-12 00:17:49	zephros	just use wal -i <path to picture> and it will change your colors
2020-05-12 00:19:09	zephros	you can also use pywal with your terminal. There's a couple lines of code on their github and put that in your shell rc file. Your terminal should have the same colors as your theme from now on.
