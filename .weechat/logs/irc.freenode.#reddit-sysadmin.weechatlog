2020-05-12 00:08:26	Hunterkll	you'd have won big
2020-05-12 00:08:46	Hunterkll	did he think he bought at 1 cent then sell at 2 cents when it was really -3 to -40 ?

2020-05-12 00:08:49	Hunterkll	how's this work
2020-05-12 00:08:59	Hunterkll	the purchase should have given him money off the bat, and it ended up closing that month's positive

2020-05-12 00:14:19	+aName	Hunterkll lol they're probably not doing so hot right now

2020-05-12 00:14:29	yuken	I can setup the VPN just fine, but no clue what to do after that.
2020-05-12 00:14:37	Hunterkll	yuken, ... you run your own DNS server
2020-05-12 00:14:41	Hunterkll	with different records than external
2020-05-12 00:14:42	+aName	Hunterkll Yeah, sure, but also, like... *I* could probably buy AMC right now lol

2020-05-12 00:15:07	Hunterkll	yuken, reverse proxy then
2020-05-12 00:15:23	Hunterkll	yuken, vhost entry in apache/nginx to reverse back to whatever the internal box is
2020-05-12 00:15:27	Hunterkll	if it's a web app
2020-05-12 00:15:29	Hunterkll	or whatever
2020-05-12 00:15:32	Hunterkll	if it's not, you'll have to NAT it back
2020-05-12 00:15:32	yuken	Not a web application or TCP.
2020-05-12 00:15:41	Hunterkll	then you'll have to do what I do for exchange
2020-05-12 00:15:46	Hunterkll	NAT it back :>
2020-05-12 00:15:52	Hunterkll	and then policy based routing outbound
2020-05-12 00:15:54	Hunterkll	:D
2020-05-12 00:15:56	yuken	I was thinking it was NAT, but I can't really figure out how to do that.
2020-05-12 00:15:59	Hunterkll	or maybe just some iptables janky
2020-05-12 00:16:05	yuken	Everything on Google seems like "VPN + NAT == bad!"
2020-05-12 00:16:11	Hunterkll	that's how i do exchange
2020-05-12 00:16:16	Hunterkll	external interface of my linode nats back
2020-05-12 00:16:24	Hunterkll	all traffic from my exchange box routes out through the linode

2020-05-12 00:20:24	yuken	er
2020-05-12 00:20:27	yuken	not SELinux, CentOS, sorry.
2020-05-12 00:20:27	Hunterkll	BECAUSE I DON'T FUCKING DISABLE SELINUX LIKE A MORON
2020-05-12 00:20:30	yuken	a CentOS box.
2020-05-12 00:20:38	+xe0n	lolll the helpdesk are tripping over their own tails
2020-05-12 00:20:39	Hunterkll	audit2allow is bae
2020-05-12 00:20:40	+xe0n	too funny
2020-05-12 00:20:43	+xe0n	so this signature update stuff
2020-05-12 00:20:44	+xe0n	LOLLL
2020-05-12 00:20:58	+aName	xe0n I love how long that drags out
2020-05-12 00:20:59	+xe0n	people arent getting the updated signatures...reason why...they weren't part of the correct groups initially
2020-05-12 00:21:07	+aName	Like... just give me a template and the input data and I'll apply it
2020-05-12 00:21:11	+aName	Why is this a thing
2020-05-12 00:21:18	+xe0n	MARKETING LOL
2020-05-12 00:21:32	+xe0n	ive said to the helpdesk, stop blind copying users in AD without checking what they're a part of
2020-05-12 00:21:40	+xe0n	one user in the wrong group, copied 20 times
2020-05-12 00:21:42	+xe0n	20 people in the wrong group
2020-05-12 00:21:45	+xe0n	x years
2020-05-12 00:21:45	+xe0n	LOL
2020-05-12 00:21:47	+xe0n	enjoy.
2020-05-12 00:22:01	+aName	So what's the argument against having a template user to copy?
2020-05-12 00:22:07	yuken	https://www.the-art-of-web.com/system/iptables-nat/ looks pretty self-explanatory.
2020-05-12 00:22:09	yuken	noice.
2020-05-12 00:22:22	+xe0n	signatures arent the users responsibility
2020-05-12 00:22:23	Hunterkll	yuken, the trick is going to be getting your internal box back out
2020-05-12 00:22:27	+xe0n	and we centrally manage them
2020-05-12 00:22:32	yuken	hmm.
2020-05-12 00:22:38	+aName	That way instead of picking a random user you just always copy template.user.accounting or template.user.hr with minimum relevant groups and such
2020-05-12 00:22:40	Hunterkll	yuken, because you'll have to tell your router to send it's traffic to the vps over the tunnel
2020-05-12 00:22:41	+xe0n	thats not the issue, the issue is....the users when created were put in the wrong security group for signatures...
2020-05-12 00:22:47	+xe0n	meaning...they've never had the correct one
2020-05-12 00:22:47	+xe0n	LOL
2020-05-12 00:22:54	Hunterkll	yuken, so *just* your internal source IP has to be redirected - this is called policy based routing
2020-05-12 00:22:59	yuken	Yeah, that sounds a lot tougher.
2020-05-12 00:23:02	+xe0n	oh no, if they did things right and followed our onboarding process, they'd be fine.
2020-05-12 00:23:05	+aName	xe0n So they were never added to the right group, not they were members of the wrong one
2020-05-12 00:23:11	Hunterkll	yuken, i have no idea how to do it in pfsense :D
2020-05-12 00:23:31	+xe0n	just...they dont, they get over confident, think they remember things and start winging processes
2020-05-12 00:23:32	+xe0n	idiots..
2020-05-12 00:23:35	+xe0n	aName, yeah...
2020-05-12 00:23:35	+xe0n	LOL
2020-05-12 00:23:42	Hunterkll	yuken, here's my 'direct' rule that is in firewalld that translates into iptables -   <rule priority="0" table="nat" ipv="ipv4" chain="PREROUTING">-i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 10.100.251.135:443</rule>
2020-05-12 00:23:42	yuken	Hmm. So, if a user connects from IP A to my VPS (IP B), and then VPS sends that over VPN + NAT to my source...
2020-05-12 00:23:48	yuken	I need to bring it back to A from B.
2020-05-12 00:23:51	+aName	xe0n Probably gonna redo most of my onboarding stuff this week. I think there's room to breathe for once.

2020-05-12 00:24:03	Hunterkll	yuken, right, otherwise your source will try and respond over the regular default route
2020-05-12 00:24:04	Hunterkll	and die
2020-05-12 00:24:22	-->	technonerd (~techno@gateway/tor-sasl/technonerd) has joined #reddit-sysadmin
2020-05-12 00:24:30	Hunterkll	yuken, you might be able to set the default route via a direct connected route, aka 0.0.0.0/0 via 10.0.0.1 dev eth0
2020-05-12 00:24:31	Hunterkll	type shit
2020-05-12 00:24:37	yuken	I mean, I could do port-based tunneling/routing instead, and that would be a lot easier. So A connects to B:25565, B connects to C
2020-05-12 00:24:39	Hunterkll	wait no
2020-05-12 00:24:40	yuken	C sends information back.
2020-05-12 00:24:41	Hunterkll	you can't
2020-05-12 00:24:44	Hunterkll	sourced based routing is bad
2020-05-12 00:24:48	misspwn	xe0n, probably more like "jim is new and doesn't have a login or email"
2020-05-12 00:24:55	+aName	xe0n truth be told, what *needs* to happen is for someone to tell me to work on that until it's done rather than me taking it upon myself to fit it in when I can
2020-05-12 00:24:56	Hunterkll	yuken, ... what
2020-05-12 00:24:58	misspwn	well when did jim start? "last week"
2020-05-12 00:25:00	yuken	or is that retarded?
2020-05-12 00:25:02	+aName	xe0n but whatever
2020-05-12 00:25:32	+aName	xe0n Easier to make it my problem and not give me time to do it right lol
2020-05-12 00:25:37	Hunterkll	yuken, ok look it's simple. you turn on masquerade on the linux box, then you do this on the PFsense box - https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/routing/directing-traffic-with-policy-routing.html
2020-05-12 00:25:44	yuken	wat
2020-05-12 00:25:46	misspwn	helpdesk doesnt have backbone and rushes to create user and gives them access to HR security groups
2020-05-12 00:25:46	yuken	there is no PFSense box.
2020-05-12 00:25:53	Hunterkll	yuken, wait i was confusing you with felda
2020-05-12 00:25:55	Hunterkll	what kind of router do you have
2020-05-12 00:26:14	Hunterkll	felda, i'm sorry
2020-05-12 00:26:26	yuken	None that I have control over.
2020-05-12 00:26:33	Hunterkll	you're basically fucked
2020-05-12 00:26:33	yuken	I'm running a VPN from a home server, to a VPS.
2020-05-12 00:26:58	Hunterkll	unless the required service is running on said 'home server'
2020-05-12 00:27:00	Hunterkll	that /might/ work
2020-05-12 00:27:03	yuken	So I can tunnel either by domain or port (whichever is "easier")
2020-05-12 00:27:04	yuken	It is, Hunterkll.
2020-05-12 00:27:07	Hunterkll	and you're NATing back straight over the tunnel
2020-05-12 00:27:09	yuken	Games running on a home server.
2020-05-12 00:27:12	Hunterkll	routing might not be a concern then
2020-05-12 00:27:14	yuken	Accessed from the VPS.
2020-05-12 00:27:19	Hunterkll	so you might be able to just light up masquerade and do the inbound rules
2020-05-12 00:27:38	Hunterkll	 <rule priority="0" table="nat" ipv="ipv4" chain="PREROUTING">-i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 10.100.251.135:443</rule>
2020-05-12 00:27:43	Hunterkll	in direct.xml firewalld lingo
2020-05-12 00:27:49	Hunterkll	obviously you're probably not doing 443
2020-05-12 00:27:50	Hunterkll	:LP
2020-05-12 00:29:21	yuken	How would that actually work though? I can see how that'd route VPS traffic to my home over the VPN
2020-05-12 00:29:33	yuken	but not vice-versa... unless I just...
2020-05-12 00:29:35	yuken	I have no clue actually.
2020-05-12 00:29:40	Hunterkll	NAT'd traffic loks like it's coming from the VPS
2020-05-12 00:29:44	Hunterkll	so it'd go back to that same source
2020-05-12 00:29:48	yuken	ah, okay.
2020-05-12 00:29:57	yuken	that makes a lot more sense. Well, that doesn't seem too hard.
2020-05-12 00:30:01	+A-KO	waddup
2020-05-12 00:30:19	yuken	Thanks Hunterkll, I hope that works well.

2020-05-12 01:38:10	yuken	Hunterkll, can I specify a domain for an iptables source rather than an IP address?
2020-05-12 01:38:16	yuken	So only X domain will be forwarded?
2020-05-12 01:38:54	Hunterkll	nope
2020-05-12 01:39:17	Hunterkll	yuken, the way DNS magic works with that is a web browser sends the hostname it's requesting in its request - other software doesn't do that
2020-05-12 01:39:24	Hunterkll	so a web server can answer for multiple domains on one IP, but only that
2020-05-12 01:40:18	catbeard	yuken: you can do it with maybe string match
2020-05-12 01:40:19	yuken	ah. so if I want to do that, I need to find or write something to do it for me.
2020-05-12 01:40:31	catbeard	or u32 with the right flags
2020-05-12 01:40:44	Hunterkll	catbeard, that comes into fancy reverse proxy type territory
