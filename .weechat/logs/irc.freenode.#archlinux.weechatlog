2020-05-12 02:52:37	NetSysFire	could be a user unit or a system unit that runs after user@1000 or something like this
2020-05-12 02:52:40	Erayaydin	Anyone using AUR polybar-git package?
2020-05-12 02:52:41	ayekat	NetSysFire: yeah, that would seem cleaner... though I wonder what happens when lingering is enabled

2020-05-12 02:53:57	@phrik	Erayaydin: Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
2020-05-12 02:54:44	Erayaydin	Its look like polybar-git out-of-date. There is jsoncpp issue (package require .21 but there is .22 version). Its look like PKGVER wrong in PKGBUILD

2020-05-12 02:55:15	NetSysFire	you can write a comment
2020-05-12 02:55:25	NetSysFire	or modify the PKGBUILD yourself
